Simple AWS-EB Zipped-file deployment

  I'm able to deploy this repo on AWS-EB by zipping the contents of this directory using the command

  (run this from within the directory)

    zip -r -X custom-docker-local.zip *

  then the extra mac-associated files need (?) to be deleted using the following

     zip -d orig-docker-container-del.zip __MACOSX/\*


Running Locally Docker and Python

  The python script, application.py, will not run locally

  I'm using the following to build docker images and run them

    docker build -t cornhundred/custom-docker-local .

    docker run -it --rm -p 9000:9000 cornhundred/custom-docker-local
